            One day at work, a boss asked his employee, "Why are you late?"
            The employee said, "Sorry, I was having computer issues."
            The boss replied, "Oh, I didn’t know you worked from home."
            The employee said, "I don’t, but my coffee machine has Wi-Fi now, and it refused to connect!"
